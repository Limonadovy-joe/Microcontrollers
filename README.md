## Microcontroller
- microcontroller unit (MCU)
- is a small computer on a **single integrated circuit.** A microcontroller contains **one or more CPUs (processor cores)** along with memory and programmable **input/output peripherals.**
- program memory in the form of **NOR flash, OTP ROM, or ferroelectric RAM** is also often included on the chip, as well as a small amount of RAM.
- microcontrollers are designed for **embedded applications**, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers

- In modern terminology, a microcontroller is similar to, **but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip (SoC).**
- A **SoC** may include a microcontroller as one of its components but usually integrates it with advanced peripherals **like a graphics processing unit (GPU), a Wi-Fi module, or one or more coprocessors.**

- Mixed-signal microcontrollers are common, integrating analog components needed to control non-digital electronic systems.
- In the context of the Internet of Things, **microcontrollers are an economical and popular means of data collection**, sensing and actuating the physical world as **edge devices**. 



## Embedded design
- A microcontroller can be considered a self-contained system with a processor, memory and peripherals and can be used as an **embedded system**.
